# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 4: January 7th, 2017###

**Today's progress** AH Tribute page. Started laying out 3x3 grid to contain media elements, biography and filmography

**Thoughts** Still haven't grasped what goes in which CSS style. Do I need to size the actual div, or what is in them, or both?

### Day 3: January 6th, 2017

**Today's progress:** More progress on AH tribute page. Managed to get the main photo into a flexbox and fit to the screen.

**Thoughts:** Used forums and figured out why the main photo wasn't moving - a hyphen in the wrong place! I still don't fully understand inheritance and cascading of css styles. For tomorrow - I will start adding and filling out the biography, filmography and quote sections. All on the same page in flexboxes. I like the grey colour scheme alongside the b&w photo. Choose better fonts!

### Day 2:January 5th, 2017

**Today's progress:** Continued working on AH tribute page. Made a navigation bar using flexbox.

**Thoughts:** This is hard! Things keep changing when I add a seemingly unrelated piece of css. Put them in a different order and hey ho               it's okay.  Definitely the way to learn - experience problems and overcome them by perseverance. Tutorials are good for                 basics but don't cover everything.

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed FreeCodeCamp and continued with javaScript lessons.
                      Started working on an Audrey Hepburn tribute page.

**Thoughts:** Struggled with converting C to F. Did a google search, found an answer and realised I was looking at it too deeply.
              First time using Flexbox. Used it for Audrey Hepburn page. Today started work on laying out a 1-3-3 grid for the front page

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
